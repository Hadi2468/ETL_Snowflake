# ETL_Snowflake
There are five projects related to the ETL pipeline that I did inside Snowflake.
Here is the description for projects:

- **Project_1:**  
Creating an internal stage and uploading a CSV file from the local computer. Then, performing "Data Transformations" and doing "Data Analysis" on transformed data.  

- **Project_2:**   
Creating another internal stage and uploading a simple JSON file from the local computer. Then, flatten the JSON file and do "Data Analysis" on the transformed data.  

- **Project_3:**   
Creating another internal stage and uploading a complex and nested JSON file from the local computer. Then, flatten the JSON file and do "Data Analysis" on the transformed data.  

- **Project_4:**   
Simulate data deletion and retrieval using the time travel option in Snowflake.

- **Project_5:**   
Create a stream on the internally staged table to track incremental changes in the data. Run a MERGE statement every 1 minute to implement Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD1) logic by creating a task in Snowflake.


***All projects are available in SQL format. The project reports are also available in PDF format.***
