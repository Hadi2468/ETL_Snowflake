# ETL_Snowflake
There are five projects related to the ETL pipeline that I did inside Snowflake.
Here is the description for projects:

- **Project_1:**  
Creating an internal stage and uploading a CSV file from the local computer. Then, performing "Data Transformations" and doing "Data Analysis" on transformed data.  

- **Project_2:**   
Creating another internal stage and uploading a JSON file from the local computer. Then, flatten the JSON file and do "Data Analysis" on the transformed data.  

* **Project_3:**   

* **Project_4:**   

* **Project_5:**
